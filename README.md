Since you have traveled so far, here's some insight into my bio.

After broaching the topic of self-driving cars on one fateful snowboarding trip, I decided to further pursue this interest. Henceforth, I focused my graduate studies on vehicle systems & robotics as well as individually attended conferences, such as the Automated Vehicle Symposium. With my experimental research in biospired navigation & localization along with my prior work experience in systems engineering at a transportation agency, I launched myself into my present work in self-driving operations. 

Besides my love for AV's, I also enjoy petting fluffy puppies, sinking my feet into the waves along the beach, & watching the sunset at higher elevated locations i.e. roof top of tall buildings, mountain summits, & cliffsides.
